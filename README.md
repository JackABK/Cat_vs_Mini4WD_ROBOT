# Cat vs Mini 4WD ROBOT

This project can be reach to auto-avoidance the cat based on Mini 4WD.

## Our thoughts
On general, the cat usually always lazy at home,
it's life is full of boring and sleeping,
so that we expected design a small robot capable of attracting the cat, 
this little robot can do his best to play with the cat.


## Robot of functions
Whether using a variety of interesting ways,to be able to attract the cat's attention, and let the cat moved,
a very important one is the robot can not be tracked by the cat, therefore the robot movement speed must be fast enough to do run action avoid the cat, and has a basic obstacle avoidance capability.

2. PIR Motion Sensor 
3. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04.)
